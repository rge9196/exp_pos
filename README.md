# Bakery/Cafe POS Application

## 1. Overview

This project is a lightweight Point-of-Sale (POS) system designed for small food retail operations.
It is built for fast counter workflows, clear operational controls, and practical audit visibility.

The application is intended for small to mid-sized retail food environments where speed, cashier usability, and reliable reporting are priorities.

## 2. Features

- Checkout with split payments
- Change calculation
- Order history and detail view
- Void and refund flows
- Z report (date-based)
- Product sales report (grouped by product and price)
- Receipt printing (80mm)
- Audit-friendly design

## 4. Frontend Structure

### Pages

- `Home`: landing screen
- `Orders`: active order entry workspace
- `Checkout`: payment allocation and confirmation
- `Ticket`: print-focused receipt view after sale
- `OrderHistory`: searchable/filterable list of past orders
- `OrderDetail`: detailed receipt-style view of a historical order
- `ZReport`: date-based sales summary
- `ProductReport`: product sales grouped by product and unit price
- `Login` and `Register`: authentication views (register can be reached directly by route)

### Zustand Stores

- `authStore`: session state, login/logout, current user lookup
- `orderStore`: active cart lines, split payments, totals, last order snapshot
- `paymentMethodsStore`: loads available payment methods from backend
- `productsStore`: product catalog loading for order entry

### Routing Structure

Core routes in `frontend/src/App.jsx`:

- `/` home
- `/login`
- `/register`
- `/orders`
- `/checkout`
- `/ticket/:id`
- `/history`
- `/orders/:id`
- `/reports/z`
- `/reports/products`

### Styling Approach

The UI uses Tailwind CSS utility classes with a consistent dark POS theme and pragmatic, low-friction layouts focused on cashier speed.

## 5. Backend API

### Auth

- `POST /api/login`
- `POST /api/logout`
- `GET /api/me`

### Orders

- `POST /api/orders`
- `GET /api/orders`
- `GET /api/orders/<id>` (frontend route equivalent: `/api/orders/:id`)
- `POST /api/orders/<id>/void` (frontend route equivalent: `/api/orders/:id/void`)
- `POST /api/orders/<id>/refund` (frontend route equivalent: `/api/orders/:id/refund`)

### Reports

- `GET /api/reports/z`
- `GET /api/reports/products`

### Payment Methods

- `GET /api/payment-methods`

## 6. Database Schema Overview

High-level tables:

- `users`: cashier/operator accounts
- `products`: sellable catalog items and baseline pricing metadata
- `orders`: order headers, totals, timestamps, status
- `order_lines`: per-item quantities, unit prices, line totals
- `payments`: payment allocations by method per order
- `payment_methods`: cash/card/deposit definitions

Key design principles:

- All monetary values are stored as integer cents.
- Audit data is retained rather than deleted.
- Refunds are stored as negative financial values.
- Voided orders are retained for traceability but excluded from report totals.

## 7. Reporting Philosophy

This system uses date-based reporting instead of register open/close session accounting.

- No open/close sessions are required.
- Reports are generated by date ranges.
- This approach supports straightforward reconciliation and easier audit review across shifts and days.

## 8. Running the App

### Backend Setup

1. Activate the backend virtual environment:
   `source backend/.venv/bin/activate`
2. If dependencies are missing, install:
   `pip install flask flask-jwt-extended cs50 werkzeug`
3. Start the API server:
   `python backend/app.py`

Backend runs on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Install frontend dependencies:
   `cd frontend && npm install`
2. Start Vite dev server:
   `npm run dev`

Frontend runs on Vite (typically `http://localhost:5173`) and proxies `/api` to backend port `5000`.

### Database Initialization

Use existing database file:

- `backend/pos.db`

Apply non-destructive schema migrations when needed:

- Checkout tables:
  `sqlite3 backend/pos.db < backend/schema_checkout.sql`
- Void/refund columns:
  `sqlite3 backend/pos.db < backend/schema_void_refund.sql`

Notes:

- These migrations are additive and do not drop existing data.
- Core table creation is also guarded in backend startup with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`.

## 9. Future Enhancements (Roadmap)

- Deposit / advance payments
- Cash drawer reconciliation workflows
- Inventory tracking integration
- Multi-terminal synchronization
- CSV export options for operational and financial reporting

## 10. License / Notes

This is an experimental POS project intended for iterative development and operational validation.
Review and harden security, compliance, and operational controls before production deployment.
